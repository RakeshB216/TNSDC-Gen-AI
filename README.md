# CIFAR-10 Image Generation with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

## Overview
This project aims to generate high-resolution and photorealistic images resembling the CIFAR-10 dataset using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The generated images can be used for various applications, including data augmentation, domain adaptation, and creative image synthesis.

## Features
- Train a GAN model to generate CIFAR-10-like images.
- Evaluate the quality and diversity of generated images using metrics such as Inception Score (IS) and Frechet Inception Distance (FID).
- Fine-tune hyperparameters and apply regularization techniques to optimize GAN training.
- Visualize generated images and training progress for analysis and debugging.

## Requirements
- Python (>=3.6)
- TensorFlow (>=2.0) or PyTorch (>=1.0)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- [Optional] CUDA-enabled GPU for faster training (recommended)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
2. Install dependencies:


## Usage
1. Prepare the CIFAR-10 dataset:
- Download the CIFAR-10 dataset from [link] and extract it.
- Preprocess the dataset (normalize, resize, etc.) as needed.

2. Train the GAN model:


3. Evaluate the generated images:


4. Visualize generated images and training progress:
